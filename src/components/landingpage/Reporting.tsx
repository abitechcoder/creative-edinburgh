          This code of conduct applies to Creative Hub Africa activities, but if
          you are being harassed by a user within or in the social orbit of
          Creative Hub Africa, we still want to know about it. We will take all
          good-faith reports of harassment by Creative Hub Africa seriously.

          victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
          about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
          third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
