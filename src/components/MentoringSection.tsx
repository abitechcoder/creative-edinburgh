          Mentoring is a process where a seasoned professional supports someone
          with less experience in their field, helping them develop skills, gain
          knowledge, and advance in their career or personal growth. Itâ€™s a
          collaborative relationship in which the mentor shares insights and
          experiences, while the mentee actively seeks feedback and learning
          opportunities. Successful mentoring is grounded in mutual respect,
          open communication, and a shared commitment to the mentee's goals.
