          Executive Director and will remain confidential unless otherwise

          that you're comfortable and that we have your consent to share
          information.

          This code of conduct applies to Creative Edinburgh activities, but if
          you are being harassed by a user within or in the social orbit of
          Creative Edinburgh, we still want to know about it. We will take all
          good-faith reports of harassment by Creative Edinburgh seriously.

          The Creative Edinburgh team reserves the right to exclude people from

          In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the

          We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
          victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
          about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
          third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
          the safety of Creative Edinburgh members or the general public. We
          will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
